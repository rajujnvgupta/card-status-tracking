#Reason for using mongo db
USED non-relational database because data we received not very much relation and huge amount of data will be create.
To handle such a huge amount of mongodb is good fit. mongodb is very much scalable and provides powerfull
indexing technique which we can used to perform faster query and highly scalable.

Mongodb can be scalled horizontally to handle huge amount of data traffic.

#Reason to Use FastAPI
FastAPI is very fast in term of development and performence because it is build on top of asyncronous nature of python.
